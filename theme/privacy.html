                                <p>History.com is an organization which creates documentaries and website articles. Due to the fact that this website is directed by television producers, I do not recommend using the Documentaries as a reliable source. However, the Website Articles, especially pertaining to the World Wars and Immigration, provide a key insight into important historical events and give descriptive overviews regarding events. I do not recommend studying from this source if you are already well-versed with concepts that you want to research more on. For MYP Individuals and Societies, this resource is crucial for World War 1, World War 2 and Rights and Protests. <p>
