                    <p>Geography Blitz is a learning engagement platform designed for IB Students to learn and develop skills and temper for Geography, in an interactive manner. Coming out of Lecture-based learning and using Reinforcement Learning through playing quizzes, IB Students can use Geography Blitz as a tool or useful resource for their studies in Geography and Integrated Humanities. This is a responsive website built through the use of Bootstrap, meaning the window dimensions are resizable. Now take an example where you are reading a digital article or handout or watching an audio-visual resource on Geography and making notes in your Notebook. If you wanted to test what you were learning simultaneously, switching tabs might be inefficient for learning because it can cause distractions. Therefore by resizing the window you can place the learning engagement platform at the top left, bottom right or anywhere else in your screen as per your choice, so that you don't have to keep switching tabs and the website is in a dedicated corner of your screen for optimal learning. Below are some points which elaborate how you can use this platform.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-white mb-3 add-letter-space">Playing Quizzes</h3>
                            <p>Playing Quizzes is simple, on the Homepage, there are a variety of options as to which quiz you can play, organized in "Quiz Blocks", designed to give the reader additional detail using a Title, short description, additional information and description image. To select a quiz to play, just click on the green "Play Quiz" Button and you will be redirected to a Difficulty Menu. This Menu will have Various Levels (Unless you are playing Geopolitics, DNI and Environment Quizzes), ranging from Level 1; Easy, Level 2; Moderate and Level 3; Hard. You can also select which level to play by clicking on the respective Button. You will now be at the Quiz Webpage and after clicking Start, you can answer questions by clicking the most suitable one out of four options. Then, the quiz showcases the difference between the selected and correct option (if any) using Light Red and Light Green colors to signify Wrong and Correct options. Remember, you have a time limit of 10 seconds per question and 30 seconds for Geography Sections quizzes, which contain additional background information in the question. The number of questions per quiz is about 10-13. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-white mb-3 add-letter-space">Using the Platform</h3>
                            <p>As mentioned earlier, you can use Geography Blitz as a supporting tool to test your knowledge in Geography and while learning by reading or watching resources, you can resize the dimensions of the website to make it smaller and place it on the corners or edges of you website, so while studying Geography, you can keep testing your knowledge. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-white mb-3 add-letter-space">Additional References</h3>
                            <p>Given in the References Tab are a list of additional useful resources that are beneficial as an IB Student, which can also be used as sources for OPCVL Source Analysis, or simply for gaining more knowledge in Geography. The are resources handpicked from the Internet which I used in my MYP Studies, and may be crucially beneficial to you also.</p>
